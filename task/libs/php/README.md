This app is to demo an API call using different parameters selected by a user, using input tags of type number.

When the "Submit" button is clicked this runs the Ajax call from script.js to getCountryInfo.php (or other php files) using the API data parameters.

If the returning data from getCountryInfo.php (or other php files) is OK, it gets written into the "Results:" section of index.html.
